- **Automated Tasks**:
  - Open web applications (Google, YouTube, ChatGPT, etc.).
  - Open local applications (Notepad, Camera, etc.).
  - Play music and control playback.
  - Manage screen brightness.
  - Take screenshots.
- **Reminders & Scheduling**: Schedule events and receive timely notifications.
- **Weather Forecast**: Get current weather conditions for any city.
- **Date & Time Information**: Provides the current date and time upon request.

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**: Core programming language.
- **Speech Recognition**: For converting speech to text.
- **Pyttsx3**: For text-to-speech (TTS) functionality.
- **Tkinter**: For creating the graphical user interface (GUI).
- **Plyer**: For sending desktop notifications.
- **Requests**: For making HTTP requests to external APIs (e.g., weather API).
- **PyAutoGUI**: For taking screenshots.
- **Screen Brightness Control**: For controlling screen brightness.
- **PyInstaller**: To package the application into an executable file.
- **PIL (Pillow)**: For handling images.
